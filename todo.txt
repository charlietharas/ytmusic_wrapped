- combine songs with identical titles and artists but different URLs (under the same URL - idfk). Create ID system instead of using URLs as identifiers).
	- maybe have a google photos "is this the same person" style prompt for these once a UI is created
	
- longest and shortest songs ??

- frequency charts for # of relistens of top 16 songs ("your sweet 16")

- longest listening session

- skip detection via timestamps of listen & duration of song (??)

- primitive documentation

- matplotlib & GUI libraries (until more aesthetic things can be found)

- make all calculations involving durations optional depending on the durations flag (from the YT api)

- this program is REALLY bad at accounting for everything
 - from leap years
 - to days not listened to music
 - to if the user doesn't have the durations
 - yeah im sure theres so much other stuff

Long-term:
- understand songs' relation to one another by their sequence
- music as NLP: each song is a word, each session a sentence
	- start by BoW model using song IDs
