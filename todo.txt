Sync Colab and GitHub/Eclipse changes

ANALYSIS
- longest listening session
- frequency charts for # of relistens of top 16 songs ("your sweet 16")
- most popular days of the week
- PLAYLISTS (this will be a little tougher?)

NEW FEATURES
- matplotlib & GUI libraries (until more aesthetic things can be found) (omw there!!)
- skip detection via timestamps of listen & duration of song (??)
- combine songs with identical titles and artists but different URLs (under the same URL - idfk). Create ID system instead of using URLs as identifiers).
	- maybe have a google photos "is this the same person" style prompt for these once a UI is created

GENERAL USABILITY
- make all calculations involving durations optional depending on the durations flag (from the YT api)
	- maybe even remove flags all together and just make a GUI because there are going to be so many options
- add an option to load watch-history, and to generate other two .csv files from just report-history
- this program is REALLY bad at accounting for everything
  - from leap years
  - to days not listened to music
  - to if the user doesn't have the durations
  - yeah im sure theres so much other stuff
  - new features are EST-only friendly (timezone flag could fix?)
- primitive documentation
- fix flags system (mostly for debugging at this pt)

LONG TERM
- understand songs' relation to one another by their sequence
- music as NLP: each song is a word, each session a sentence
	- start by BoW model using song IDs
