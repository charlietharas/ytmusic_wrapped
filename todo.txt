- combine songs with identical titles and artists but different URLs (under the same URL - idfk). Create ID system instead of using URLs as identifiers).
	- maybe have a google photos "is this the same person" style prompt for these once a UI is created

- frequency charts for # of relistens of top 16 songs ("your sweet 16")

- longest listening session
- most amount of times listened to a song within a day

- song of each month

- skip detection via timestamps of listen & duration of song

- primitive documentation

- matplotlib & GUI libraries (until more aesthetic things can be found)

- mass data analysis functions in a separate class after using a few spreadsheets to standardize (!!!)

Long-term:
- understand songs' relation to one another by their sequence
- music as NLP: each song is a word, each session a sentence
	- start by BoW model using song IDs
